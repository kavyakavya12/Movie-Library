![movie-library](https://github.com/kavyakavya12/Movie-Library/assets/109808086/ac63f39f-926f-4b74-8564-a42ec07af2fa)

I have created a movie library system! Here, I pick the best movies for people to discover using the OMDb API. Users may even construct their own personalized playlists that include their favorite flicks. These playlists are publicly accessible.

# Features of project
The registration page requires the following information: name, email, password, repeat password, and contact number. The Login Page includes a username and password for login. The Home Page has a navigation bar (Search, Logout, Username), an About page with contact information, and a footer. The Search Page has a search box for searching for movies by title, and when you click on a movie poster, it displays movie data such as name, rating, actors, description, and so on. Clicking the bookmark button adds it to your watchlist, and clicking the trashcan button removes it.

# Technologies used
A website's front end is built using three languages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Servlet and JSP are utilized as back-end technologies in web application development. MySQL is the database that stores user information when they register on the website.

# How to create an API Key for the OMDb API?
Navigate to http://www.omdbapi.com/, the OMDb API website, and select the "API Key" option from the top menu.
Fill out the form with your name, email address, and the reason for your request to use the API. Choose whether you wish to use the API for commercial or personal reasons. Then click Submit.
OMDb API will provide you your API key via email. at use the API key, add it at the end of the API endpoint URL.
We should replace the URL with the search "s" parameter because we are looking for movies by title.
